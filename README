This project was created by Elijah Gray.

Unfortunately I was ill with pneumonia on the day of this in-class assignment. I reached out to some others if I could work with them
but didnt get a response so I ended up doing it myself. I took one of the in-class examples we got for rendering 3D graphics
as a starting point. I made some changes to the program such as changing the shape, adding a UI, and adding a sound effect
based on the highest axis velocity of the heart. I was worried this may be overly simple but I did work alone.
