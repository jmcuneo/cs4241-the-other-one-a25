It's lowkey confusing when you go to the render link, because the original A3 and the Svelte A3 is the exact same. 

When you go to the render link, and open the nav bar, you can click Shift Tracker or go to the nav bar and click ICE04 (Svelte)

You will see all of the components within the login page and the application, as we used Svelte for components, and at the top, where you see the link. It'll show ice04 for the Svelte version and ice04# when it's the original A3. It's confusing to differentiate between the two since the styling is the same. 

### Contributions
We all worked cohesively together using Nias computer, to prevent merge conflicts. Since we had to complete this assignment within the class period, merge conflicts would have occured if we all worked on different branches. We decided to use her shift tracker since it seemed the easiest to implement components into what she already had. We decided to use Svelte because none of us have had any experience with it and we all felt like it would be something fun to learn. We searched up all the necessary documentation and pair programmed as nia as the typer, and us as the guider when it came to documentation and code implementation. We kept the same A3 files from what Nia had used and just added the components section within the client.
