### Description
This project uses the Web Audio API to take microphone and audio input, and display a spectrogram visualization as the output.

### Instructions
In order to use this project, you must first enable microphone access on your browser. From there, you can either visualize the microphone audio input
or select a file to play. By default, the microphone is selected. Click the checkbox to switch between the two. You can play the audio file
by pressing the play button, and stop by pressing the pause button.
