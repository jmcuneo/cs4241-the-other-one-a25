## Application Details
- The project is a to-do list that allows users to add a to-do to a list, which tracks the task name, creation date, priority, and deadline. However, we ran into issues with implementing the application with Vite because the server had the issue of running the local server on port 3000 and Vite running on 5173, resulting in a CORS error when the server tried to communicate with Vite. The main page was succesfully converted to React.

- The server issue was figured out with 5 minutes left in class. The table and forms were also finished. We did not get time to test the server, but the implementation should match according to how Colin did it in A2. Issues happened during deployment but the server works locally.
