In this activity, we did a simplified version of A4 Creative Coding. More specifically, we use three.js with tweakpane controls.


Contributions: 
Eric - Defined server structure, separating out logic for shape, stage, and camera. Added colors and panels
Alex - Worked on the knot, and general added parameters and shapes, colors, animations. 
John - Add Torus object and panel to modify animation
Alexander - I tried to set up anaglyph effect and import gltf objects, but neither of these worked and I could not get the imports to work. I otherwise helped set up and changed the shapes
