As a group, we divided up and each took our own technology for the Creative Coding Part of the assignment, where
Matthew Franco did D3, Maxwell Jeronimo did Three.js, and Ryan Nemeti did Tone.js.  Franco's part of the assignment
included

Jeronimo's part of the assignment included a clicking game, where your score would be kept track by how many cubes
you clicked that were falling from the sky, and if you missed 5 of the cubes the game would end.  The cubes would speed
up after a certain amount of time to retain some difficulty.

In order to access other part's of the assignment, the names of everyone will be on the top as a link to traverse.
