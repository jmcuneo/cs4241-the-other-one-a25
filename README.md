# ICE 04: The Other One

## Team Number: 6 -- Kyra Brown, Andreas Keating, Christopher Yon, Ceci Herriman, Michael Lin

## Creative Coding -- Cube City 

Project Link: https://cs4241-ice04-group6.onrender.com/ 

To create our Cube City project, our team used three.js. Cube City is an immersive application where users can spin, add, and move various cubes of different colors.

To rotate the main central cube, the user can use the x, y, and z sliders at the top of the screen. To move the camera, there are x, y, and z camera sliders that the user can interact with. You can also click and drag to pan and change view. To add another cube to a random position, press "a". To run the "explode" feature, press "f".
