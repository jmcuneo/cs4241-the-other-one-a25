For this ICE activity, I chose the Creative Coding option. I extended my Assignment 2 by adding a new page called creative.html that visualizes the grocery list data using the HTML Canvas API.

When I add items to the grocery list on the main page, I can then open /new-cod.html to see each grocery item represented as a circle. The circles are drawn dynamically based on the data returned from the /items endpoint in my server.

How to use:
- Go to the main page and add grocery items (name, category, expiration date).
- The list updates with the items.
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/new-code.html
[/new-code.html](https://ice04-hrithikaravishankar.onrender.com/new-code.html)
- Circles will be drawn on a canvas, one for each item in the grocery list.
