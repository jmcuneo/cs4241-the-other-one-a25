# ICE 04: The Other One

I am doing Components as my Assignment Four so I took on Creative Coding for this. Since I wasn't in class the day this was done, in order to replicate the planning and time management aspect of the activity, once I decided which technology I wanted to pursue, I decided to set a two hour timer to see both what I thought I could and actually could get done in that short time.
I decided to try out D3 and landed on depicting the Pokédex dateset with the initial idea of using a bar chart before quickly pivoting to a bubble chart. My plan was to try and make a bubble chart that depicts the spawn rates of the 151 Pokémon, where the user could toggle whether they wanted to see it by individual Pokémon or by type. However, figuring out how to make the bubble chart actually be a bubble chart and not just a bunch of circles stacked on top of each other ended up being a bit more difficult than I expected (I used the framework of your tutorial and looked at https://observablehq.com/@d3/bubble-chart/2, https://observablehq.com/@d3/pack/2, and https://d3js.org/d3-force/simulation as references), though to be fair I also ended up getting caught on some of the smaller details like figuring out a way to put the text on a new tab since slash n wasn't working and getting a good RGBA combo that would scale from approximately red to blue, small things on their own but together also ate up a decent amount of the time.
Overall, it's not super extravagent but I hope both the final product and the way I tried to do it at least got the spirit of the assignment.
