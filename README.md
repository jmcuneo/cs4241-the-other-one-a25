# ICE 04: The Other One
We did the Components project.

Hosting Link: Unable to host the application, was told to just do a Pull Request and not worry about hosting
Names: Ayush Kulkarnigroup, Grace Robinson, Kelsey Bishqemi, Lucas Marble
Group Number: Group 8
Contributions: All group members worked to incorporate React and change the application to use Express. We as a group followed the cs4241-guides/using.react.md guide to figure out how to implement the necessary frameworks. Unfortunately, we were unable to get the table to render and be able to successfully add data to the table after submitting the data. There was an effort to fix this issue with rendering the table but ran out of time.
Instructions: After opening the application the user can fill out the prompts. The user must input name, year, windspeed, and air pressure. The year, windspeed, and air pressure must be a number value while the name must be a string. Press the submit to add information to table. Unfortunately, the table does not Render.
