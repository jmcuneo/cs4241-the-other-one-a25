Assignment 4 - Creative Coding: Interactive Multimedia Experiences
===


The interactive experience should possess a reasonable level of complexity. Some examples:
### Three.js
- A generative algorithm creates simple agents that move through a virtual world. Your interface controls the behavior / appearance of these agents.
- A simple 3D game. You really want this to be a simple as possible or it will be outside the scope of this assignment.
- An 3D audio visualization of a song of your choosing. User interaction should control aspects of the visualization.
